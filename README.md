# react-native-bestpratice
In this readme file, you will find the best practice recommended to develop a react native app.

## Folder Structure & Architecture

Let’s first restructure the application code to make it more robust and scalable. This will make it easy for on-boarding new resources by defining a common approach for the development process.

Please find below the structure of the app and all the changes explained below:

<p align="left">
 <img src="https://github.com/luvgadhvi/react-native-bestpratice/blob/main/images/folderastructure.png" width="500" >
</p>

### /index.js :
- It is the default entry point of every react-native application. There are no changes in this file at all.

### /App/… :
- All the resources generated by the team for our application must reside within this directory.
- This will be the core application source code.<br />
- ```“/App/index.js” ``` file is the container of our app and served as the entry point.

### /components:
- Only shared components used across features are placed here.
- All the components should be registered and exported from /index.js for a single access point.
- All the components should bear named export. This will avoid any conflicts.
- Components that consist of complex logic or redux integration, can be further de-structured into ComponentContainer.js & ComponentView.js as per the      
  Container-View pattern (this will be covered ahead in /screens part).

### /config :
- All the app’s configurations are to be kept at this path.
- This can consist of data format, default language, some master data set or anything like so.

### /i18n :
- Internationalisation or multi-lingual support is achieved by the use of the “i18n” library.
- It mainly consists of a configuration file and all the language translations in independent language.json files.

### /navigation :
- As the name suggests, all the routing logic resides here.
- This app contains only one stack of navigation. Although, most of the apps will have minimum 2 navigators; viz before and after authentication.<br/>
- Ideally, all different navigators should be re-factored in separate files and then used in “Navigator.js”.<br/>
- ROUTES.js consists of all the constants for various available routes within our app.<br/>
- /components directory will hold all the navigation specific components like headers, title bars, action buttons, like so.

### /redux :
- It holds all the redux resources at one place.
- This includes action creators, reducers and store of our app.
- CONSTANTS.js has all the action types.
- /actions.js consist of all the action-creators. Considering the demo app, there is only 1 action-creator, it can be broken into multiple files and can be into distributed locations feature/screen wise.<br/>
- /reducer.js reduces all the actions to store. Same applies for reducers. For a wider scope of app, this can become an app level root-reducer which merges various feature-level reducers using redux’s combineReducers function.<br/>
- /store.js is the central store of the application. This incorporates all the mapping between reducer, store and middle-wares if any.<br/>

### /screens :
- This is the heart of our application.
- All the various features/screens/pages are defined here. In this case, “Scan”, “UserId” and “ConfirmActivity” are 3 different screens of this demo app.
- Each screen consists of an index.js file which exports the screen’s container as default module which makes the screen available to be utilised as a component.

### /services :
- Services are to manage all api requests. You can see them as a bridge/an adapter between the server API and the view layer (scenes and components) of your   application.
- It can take care of network calls your app will make, get and post content, and transform payloads as needed before being sent or saved in the store of your   app (such as Redux).
- The screens and components will only dispatch actions, read the store and update themselves based on the new changes.
- Actions will use services. Thunk is a redux middleware used to handle asynchronous actions and side-effects.
- You can use “axios” for REST API calls in your service handlers or you can use any SDK like firebase sdk for direct DB interaction inside handler methods.

### /styles :
- This module holds our application-level styles.
- It can include theme definition (font, colours, typography) of the app UI, and global styles.

### /utils :
- All the utility/helper methods, validations, etc that can be shared across our entire project are added here.


## Architecture Dependencies
We’ll start adding features/capabilities to our application one-by-one now. List of all the dependencies for our ReactNative project and its integration for a better architecture:

### React-navigation
- It will avail routing and navigation capability to our React native app. It provides us with various navigator implementations like Stack-navigation, Tabs-navigation or Drawer/Side-tray navigation.
- React-navigation library also provides features like maintaining history of user journey along with gestures and animations that you may expect from a native mobile app.
- Use the following command to add a react-navigation library. We’ll also require stack-navigation for this app :- <br />
``` $ npm install -S @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack ``` <br />
```$ npm install react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view  ```
### Redux & Thunk
- Redux is used for the provision of a central store. All the data that needs to be shared across features, modules or react-component tree, can be added to the redux store.
- Thunk is the middleware that works hand-in-hand with redux for handling the side-effects like fetching data from database, REST APIs, application processing delays, etc. It is promise based.<br/>
``` $ npm install — save redux react-redux ``` <br/>
```$ npm install — save redux-thunk ```

### UI Library — Material design library (react-native-paper)
- It will avail routing and navigation capability to our React native app. It provides us with various navigator implementations like Stack-navigation, Tabs-navigation or Drawer/Side-tray navigation.
- React Native Paper is a cross-platform UI component library which follows the material design guidelines, with global theming support and an optional babel-plugin to reduce bundle-size.
- It uses vector-icons library, a set of customisable icons for React native with support for NavBar/TabBar/ToolbarAndroid, image source and full styling.
- Use the below command to add it in the project:- <br/>
  ``` $ npm install — save react-native-paper ```<br/>
  ``` $ npm install — save react-native-vector-icons ```
